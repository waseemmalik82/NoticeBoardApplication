Description of Project
Presently handheld devices such as smartphones are using very huge. We are using them to
ease our daily life. Notice Board is one of the best medium to communicate with mass
audience. Many state of the art universities around the world rely on wooden notice board
hanging on the wall to display announcements. The older ways is not so convenient and
handy for the students, as they have to spare some time and go to have a look on the notice
board everyday to check latest announcements and updates. So here is a need to update the
way we use to see the announcements/notifications.
Our Notice Board Application is an e-mail based and android driven application system,
designed to improve the noticing process by using e-mail. This will save the time of students
and will provide them convenience by providing latest updates and notifications from the
university through e-mail.
The admin can add new notifications which will be instantly uploaded to the server and
students can see them after login to the application and some specific notifications though
e-mail on their smartphones or other devices. This will help in decreasing the ambiguity
which students face due to lack of proper communication from CR/GR as they might forget
to convey the message or maybe they convey the message late due to any certain reason.
